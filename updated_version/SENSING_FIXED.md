# 🎉 SENSING POPUPS - FIXED AND WORKING! 🎉

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

**Issue**: Breeze and stench weren't being detected in the GUI because the agent was overwriting the sensing information when moving to a new cell.

**Solution**: Modified the agent to store the original cell content before placing the agent marker, allowing proper sensing detection.

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL FIX**

### **Agent Modifications**
1. **Added `current_cell_content` attribute** to store what's under the agent
2. **Modified `move()` method** to capture cell content before overwriting with 'A'
3. **Updated `AI_play()` method** to check stored content instead of current world cell

### **Key Code Changes**
```python
# In move() method:
self.current_cell_content = self.world.get_cell(new_x, new_y)

# In AI_play() method:
if self.current_cell_content == 'B' or self.current_cell_content == 'BS':
    self.current_breeze = True
```

## ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING**

### **Test Results**
- ✅ **Breeze Detection**: Working at positions with 'B' cells
- ✅ **Stench Detection**: Working at positions with 'S' cells
- ✅ **Combined Sensing**: Working at positions with 'BS' cells
- ✅ **Popup Events**: Generated correctly for all sensing types
- ✅ **GUI Display**: Sensing information updates in real-time

### **Debug Output Example**
```
Step 24: SENSING DETECTED: Sensing: BREEZE
Step 28: SENSING DETECTED: Sensing: BREEZE
Step 32: SENSING DETECTED: Sensing: BREEZE
```
